Price Predictions

This script performs a regression analysis to predict car prices based on various features. It loads a dataset, handles missing values through imputation, performs feature engineering, applies one-hot encoding and scaling, trains a Random Forest Regressor model, and evaluates its performance. The code emphasizes data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and scaling numeric features to optimize model performance. Specifically, it utilizes Random Forests for their ability to handle complex relationships within the data. The script also implements logging for tracking and debugging.
